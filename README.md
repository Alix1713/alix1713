### Hi there 👋
I am a student that just graduated from a full stack web development course at UC Berkley extension program. This github shows the progression of my work as I advanced through the program from September 2021 to December 2021. Currently in January 2022 I have signed up for a course in React w/ Redux, Hooks, and GraphQL through Udemy to continue learning as I apply for my first tech job or internship.
